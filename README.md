# Spring Boot Microservices With Spring Cloud

## Roadmap:

- Develop Microservices with Spring Boot
- Deploy and manage Spring Boot Microservices with Spring Cloud
- Deconstruct a monolith into Spring Boot Microservices
- Best Practices for Developing RESTFul APIs with Spring MVC
- Consume RESTFul APIs using Spring RestTemplate
- Use Java Bean Validation with Spring Boot
- Use Project Lombok and MapStruct to reduce boilerplate code
- Generate API documentation with Spring REST Doc
- Configure Jackson for JSON processing with Spring Boot
- Use JMS for messaging between Spring Boot Microservices
- Use Spring State Machine to Apply the Saga Pattern with Microservices

## Details:

- Develop RESTful Services using Spring MVC
- Consume RESTFul Services with Spring RestTemplate
- Use Project Lombok
- Use MapStruct
- Spring Data JPA with Hibernate
- Configuration of Spring Boot for MySQL and H2
- Use and configure Jackson for processing JSON with Spring Boot
- Data validation with Spring Boot and Hibernate Validator
- Documentation and testing of Spring Boot microservices using Spring RESTdocs
- Standardize dependencies using Apache Maven
- Spring Application Events
- Use JMS Messaging using Apache ActiveMQ Artemis
- The microservice Saga Pattern
- Use Spring State Machine for coordinating Sagas
- Integration Testing using Spring Boot and JUnit 5
- Use WireMock with JUnit 5
- Use Awaitility in your Integration Tests - a library which provides a simple DSL for asynchronous systems testing
- The API Gateway pattern using Spring Cloud Gateway
- Load Balanced Routes using Netflix Ribbon / Spring Cloud Loadbalancer
- Service Registration using Netflix Eureka
- Service Discovery with Netflix Eureka
- Service Discovery using Spring Cloud OpenFeign
- Circuit Breaker Pattern using Resilience4J and Hystrix / Spring Cloud OpenFeign
- Manage configuration with Spring Cloud Config
- Distributed tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin
- Secure Spring Cloud with Spring Security
- Use Docker to create images for your Spring Boot applications
- Push Docker Images to Docker Hub
- Configure Logback with Logstash for JSON logging output
- Use Docker Compose to start and stop your microservices
- Use ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for consolidated Logging
- Provision virtual machines in the cloud for Eureka, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis, Spring Cloud Config, Zipkin,
  Elasticsearch, and Kibana.
- Provision MySQL databases using Digital Ocean.
- Create Docker Droplets (aka Virtual Machines) in Digital Ocean
- Deploy Spring Cloud Config in the cloud with Eureka
- Create a Docker Swarm Cluster for Spring Boot Microservices
